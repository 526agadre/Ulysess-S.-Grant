            <h1>Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant</h1>
            <p>Ulysses S. Grant served as the 18th president of the United States from 1869 to 1877. A former Union general in the Civil War, he was elected as a Republican and focused on Reconstruction, civil rights, and economic growth.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Key Aspects of Grant’s Strategy</h2>

        <button class="accordion">1. Reconstruction and Civil Rights</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Grant was committed to enforcing Reconstruction and protecting the rights of newly freed
                African Americans. He supported the 15th Amendment, which granted voting rights to African
                American men, and used federal troops to combat the rise of white supremacist groups like the
                Ku Klux Klan, ensuring civil rights protections in the South.
                </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">2. Economic Policies and the Panic of 1873</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Grant’s presidency faced significant economic challenges, including the Panic of 1873, a severe
                depression triggered by railroad speculation and banking failures. While his administration
                struggled with the economic downturn, he focused on stabilizing the economy, promoting the
                gold standard, and seeking to reduce government corruption in financial dealings.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">3. Indian Affairs and Westward Expansion </button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Grant’s administration aimed to improve relations with Native Americans by adopting a more
                humane &quot;peace policy,&quot; focusing on the establishment of reservations and offering protection for
                tribes. However, this policy was not fully successful and was met with resistance, leading to
                continued conflict on the frontier.
                </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">4. Foreign Policy and Diplomacy</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Grant’s foreign policy achievements included efforts to expand U.S. influence globally. His
                administration negotiated the Treaty of Washington in 1871, resolving tensions with Great
                Britain over the Alabama Claims, and sought to improve relations with Latin America through
                the promotion of Pan-Americanism.
                </p>
        </div>
        <div class="summary">
            <p>During his presidency, Grant supported the rights of freed African Americans and used federal troops to combat the Ku Klux Klan. However, his administration faced numerous scandals, including the Whiskey Ring and the Crédit Mobilier affair, which damaged his reputation.</p>
