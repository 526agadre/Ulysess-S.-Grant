            <h1>Leadership of Ulysses S. Grant</h1>
            <p>Ulysses S. Grant was known for his aggressive and unyielding approach to military strategy, which helped the Union achieve victory in the Civil War. His leadership was defined by a commitment to relentless pursuit, strategic flexibility, and the importance of maintaining constant pressure on the enemy.</p>

        <h2>Key Aspects of Grant’s Strategy</h2>

        <button class="accordion">1. War of Attrition</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Grant embraced a strategy of attrition, understanding that the Union’s larger manpower and resources could outlast the Confederacy's ability to sustain prolonged conflict. Rather than focusing on isolated victories, he sought to wear down Confederate forces through continuous combat and logistical pressure.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">2. Unified Command</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>In 1864, Grant was appointed General-in-Chief of the Union Army. Unlike many previous Union commanders who operated independently, Grant coordinated the efforts of multiple Union armies to work in tandem. He directed simultaneous campaigns on various fronts, creating a unified effort to defeat the Confederacy.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">3. Relentless Pursuit</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Grant was famous for not allowing Confederate forces any respite. He followed Robert E. Lee’s army closely during the Overland Campaign in 1864, despite suffering heavy losses at battles like the Wilderness and Cold Harbor. He understood that even after facing setbacks, pressing the fight was crucial.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">4. Key Battles</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <ul>
                <li><span>Vicksburg (1863):</span> Grant’s victory at Vicksburg was one of his finest moments, as it gave the Union control of the Mississippi River, cutting the Confederacy in half and weakening its logistical capabilities.</li>
                <li><span>Gettysburg (1863):</span> While Grant was not directly involved, his strategic coordination during the war helped shape the success at Gettysburg, which, alongside Vicksburg, turned the tide of the war in favor of the Union.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="summary">
            <p>Grant’s military leadership was characterized by his willingness to fight hard and persistently, despite heavy casualties. His decisive role in the final stages of the war, particularly his pursuit of Lee's Army, ultimately led to the Confederacy’s collapse and the Union's victory.</p>
