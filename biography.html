                <h2>About Ulysses S. Grant</h2>
                <p>
                    Ulysses S. Grant was born on April 27, 1822, in Point Pleasant, Ohio. Raised in a modest
                    family. His father, Jesse Grant, was a tanner. He had four siblings, with Grant being the eldest.
                    <br> Their family faced financial struggles. He attended the United States Military Academy at West
                    Point, graduating in 1843. Grant served in the Mexican-American War, where he earned </br>
                    recognition for his bravery and leadership. Afterward, he struggled with peacetime military life,
                    resigning from the army in 1854 and taking up various civilian jobs. However, the outbreak of
                    the Civil War in 1861 revitalized his career. Grant re-enlisted, and his rise was swift, especially
                    after his decisive victories at Fort Henry, Fort Donelson, and Vicksburg, culminating in his
                    appointment as General-in-Chief of the Union Army in 1864.
