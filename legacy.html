            <h1>Legacy of Ulysses S. Grant</h1>
            <p>Ulysses S. Grant’s legacy is defined by his leadership during the Civil War and his efforts as the 18th president of the United States. As a Union general, Grant played a crucial role in securing victory, leading his forces to key wins at Vicksburg and Appomattox. His aggressive strategies and determination helped bring an end to the conflict and preserve the Union.</p>

        <h2>Key Aspects of Grant’s Strategy</h2>

        <button class="accordion">1. Victory in the Civil War</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Grant’s leadership and military strategy were pivotal in securing Union victory. His relentless
                pursuit of Confederate forces and his successful campaigns, particularly at Vicksburg and
                Appomattox, were instrumental in breaking the Confederacy’s will to fight and ending the Civil
                War.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">2. Reconstruction and Civil Rights</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>As president, Grant strongly supported Reconstruction and worked to protect the rights of freed
                slaves. His administration passed the 15th Amendment, securing voting rights for African
                American men, and enforced civil rights protections, though progress was often slow and
                contested.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">3. Presidential Legacy and Challenges</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Grant’s presidency is marked by his efforts to stabilize the post-war nation, but it was also
                marred by political corruption scandals, such as the Credit Mobilier and Whiskey Ring scandals.
                Despite these issues, he is remembered for his personal integrity and commitment to the Union.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">4. Military Leadership and Reputation</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Grant’s reputation as a military leader has evolved over time. Initially criticized for his heavy-
                handed tactics, he is now praised for his strategic vision and determination. His role in the Civil
                War cemented his place as one of America’s greatest military leaders.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="summary">
            <p>Later in life, Grant wrote his memoirs, which became one of the most celebrated military autobiographies. Though his presidency was controversial, his military leadership and dedication to justice cemented his place as a significant figure in American history.</p>
